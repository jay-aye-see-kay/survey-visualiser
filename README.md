# Culture Ampâ€™s Front End Coding Test

This is my solution to the coding challenge supplied by Culture Amp on the 22nd of Jan 2020. The problem is described in `problemDescription.md`.

Architectural decisions have been captured in the `/adr` directory.


## Dev set up

## Deployment

## Assumptions

* There are only two url patterns `/surveys` and `/surveys/:surveyId`. While the second url pattern references `/survey_results/surveyId` this url responds with a 503 bad gateway, and all the data referenced in the problem description is supplied by the two working urls: "The details you can get for each survey include all of the response data".
