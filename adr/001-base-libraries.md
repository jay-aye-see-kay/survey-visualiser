# Problem

I want to build an effective solution that also shows my programming ability, in less than 8 hours. The minimum application requirements are quite simple so there is lots of room to be creative displaying data.


# Reasoning

To get this done in time, it's important to use tech that I'm familiar with, so I should keep to what I know, at least to get the bare minimum done.

But this is also an opportunity to learn something new and if I spend a bit of extra time on it that seems like a good deal. I'll refer to using an unfamiliar tool as using an innovation token. I really what I know about `tailwindcss` and that it's usable outside of react (unlike `styled-components` which I normally use).

As I'm working with an api I didn't write I don't know if I can trust it's response. For this reason I'll use `io-ts` to validate the shape of the data coming from the api and I can provide fast meaningful feedback to the user and api provider if there are any server errors. I really like working with this library but I've found others can take a while to get used to it, if I was working with other I would discuss this decision with them first.


# Outcome

Use `react`, `redux`, and `typescript` as my base tech as I know them well and they are a good fit for the problem.

Use `redux-starter-kit` as I've had good experiences with it and it will save me time setting up `redux`.

Use `io-ts` to validate data coming from the api.

Use `tailwindcss` for styling, this is my only planned use of an innovation token.
