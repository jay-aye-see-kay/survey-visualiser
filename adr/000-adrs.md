# Problem

I want a way to communicate my design decision making process. I worry that architectural decisions won't get properly captured in git commits.


# Reasoning

I have used ADRs (architectural decision records) on previous projects and while a little clumsy they have been effective.


# Outcome

Use simple ADRs to capture my decision making.
